London is considered to be one of the world's most important global cities and has been termed the world's most investment friendly, most popular for work, and the most vegetarian friendly city in the world.  London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. It has a strong Indian population which is growing every year. It is the most-visited city as measured by international arrivals with considerable amount of Indian tourists. It'll be an excellent investment opportunity with growing demand for good restaurants for the indian migrants as well as the tourists."
